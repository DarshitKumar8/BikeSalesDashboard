3. **Customize Views:** 
   - Modify pivot tables or charts based on your specific analysis needs.
   - Add or remove filters to focus on particular datasets.

## Data Sources
The dashboard uses historical bike sales data and may include additional data from the following sources:
- **Internal Sales Records:** Data collected from company sales and transaction records.

## Customization
- **Modifying Visualizations:** Customize charts by right-clicking on them and selecting format options to suit your reporting style.
- **Extending Analysis:** Use Excel formulas and functions to create additional metrics as needed.
